# Chessboard App

This is a hobby implementation of Chess rules in React.js.
At core, it relies on Williams Nimi's coordinate representation of squares using the cartesian coordinate system originally implemented [here](https://github.com/WilliamsNimi/Chess_Logic)

## Local setup

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm i` to install packages
- Run `npm start` to start the app in your local browser
